Species is a straightforward java swing application that stores information about animal species, including images.  It also uses a custom look and feel, image display, and a grid display.

I wrote this as a final project in high school, just to show my ability to use swing and other Java fundamentals. It's here to stay as a reference of how to do some decently complicated things in swing, if I ever am forced to write swing code again (let's hope not).
