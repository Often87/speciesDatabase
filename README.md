Species is a straightforward java swing application that stores information about animal species, including images.  It also uses a custom look and feel, image display, and a grid display.

I wrote this as a final project in high school, just to show my ability to use swing and other Java fundamentals. It's here to stay as a reference of how to do some decently complicated things in swing, if I ever am forced to write swing code again (let's hope not). 

The Species.jar is an executable jar, though you will need the data and Image folders for it to work correctly.
